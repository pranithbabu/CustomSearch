# CustomSearch
Hello Guys,

This project is a demo of using C# for interaction with search engine.
This is still in draft version, able to talk to Google Search Engine.
For using this,

We need to have two things:

1) Google Api Key
2) Google Search Engine ID

We can get those by following below link:

Trial keys have limited capabilities :)
